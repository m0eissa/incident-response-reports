## What is an Incident Response Report?

In cybersecurity, the question isn't whether a security incident will transpire, but rather when it will occur. Incident response reports act as a conduit between the identification and remediation of threats, archiving past incidents, and providing invaluable lessons for preempting and mitigating future threats.

## Importance of Incident Response Reports

Incident Response (IR) reports are crucial for:

- Reflecting on and adjusting current processes, people, and technology.
- Limiting and mitigating the impact of security breaches.
- Providing a blueprint for future incident responses.
- Ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Incident Response Report Template

Use the following template as a starting point for your incident response reports:

- **Executive Summary**
- **Technical Analysis**
- **Impact Analysis**
- **Response and Recovery Analysis**
- **Diagrams**
- **Appendices**

## Incident Identification and Categorization

Quickly identifying and categorizing incidents is essential for effective incident response. Common incident types include:

- Malware
- Phishing
- DDoS attacks
- Unauthorized access
- Data leakage
- Physical breach

## Incident Reporting Process

A cohesive incident reporting process involves:

1. **Initial Incident Detection**
2. **Preliminary Analysis**
3. **Incident Logging**
4. **Notification of Relevant Parties**
5. **Detailed Investigation & Reporting**
6. **Final Report Creation**
7. **Feedback Loop**
